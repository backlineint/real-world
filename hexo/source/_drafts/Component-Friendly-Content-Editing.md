## Section Outline

* So many options out there. We've found that a combination of tools provides the best experience.
* Nodes with Paragraph Fields with Panelizer and Panels IPE enabled.
* Content on the node functions as initial wizard.  Anything custom to that node, mostly using paragraph fields.
* Saving node brings to Panels IPE.  You see Node specific content, along with default blocks.
* Can re-arrange and add custom blocks.
* Fields and blocks are components using paragraphs.
* Paragraphs use UI Patterns to define and map components.

Notes:
* Provide in-context representations of components
* Either image in description, or better yet, linking to pattern library component.
