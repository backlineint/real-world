Maybe fold this in to other sections?

Approaches and patterns used for more heavy duty component theming things.

* pattern-library: true for handling PL specific functionality.
* Add tags at the top of pattern lab files to reference where it is used in Drupal.
* In the card example, using the block to wrap or not wrap content in paragraph tags.
* Render the component in Drupal with Dummy data, map it to the real data.
* Using Drupal Behaviors outside of Drupal.
