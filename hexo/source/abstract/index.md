## Component Based Drupal Theming in the Real World

Since the release of Drupal 8 great strides have been made related to developing a component based theming workflow that takes advantage of the best that Twig has to offer and plays nice with living style guides and pattern libraries. We've seen examples of Drupal and tools like Pattern Lab and KSS sharing the exact same markup. People are building real sites using this component based approach, and I'm one of them.

While there are a number of great talks and resources on the basics of setting up this workflow, there hasn't been enough discussion around the challenges that arise when you really put this approach through its paces. How do you manage complicated mappings between Drupal and your component library?  How far should we really be going to tame Drupal's markup?  How does this approach to theming scale with a team of developers, including ones who might not be as interested in your new-fangled approach to theming? Once we've built our components, how do we create a content editing experience in Drupal that makes the best use of them?

It's time to find out what happens when component based theming in Drupal 8 stops being polite... and starts getting real.  We'll look at common patterns that arise when you try to scale this approach, and some tools to try to lessen the pain. We'll also look at what this all could mean for the future of component theming in Drupal and what needs to change to get there.
