Section Outline:
* ...

Notes:

List out all of the tools.  Discuss how they are assembled.
Everyone builds a card component for some reason, so let's do that.

What is the easiest way to spin up an example card?  Probably still neato refills.

BEM Structure:
* Show example BEM structure for a card.
* Show exmaple markup BEM structure for a card.
* Show example pattern lab BEM structure for a card.

Workflow: Build components in Pattern Lab first, then map to Drupal.

Theme structure.  Everything lives in source.

Note: Initial cover images should be the towns from the real world seasons.
