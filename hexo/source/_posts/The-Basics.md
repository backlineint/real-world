Section Outline:

There has been quite a bit of ink and video spilled about component based approahces to theming in Drupal 8 (and you can look back to a number of them in the <a href="/Resources">resources section</a>.)

I'm not going to introduce or sell you on this style guide aproach, let's just dive in.

Everyone builds a card component for some reason, so let's do that.

What is the easiest way to spin up an example card?  Probably still neato refills.

BEM Structure:
* Show example BEM structure for a card.
* Show exmaple markup BEM structure for a card.
* Show example pattern lab BEM structure for a card.

Workflow: Build components in Pattern Lab first, then map to Drupal.

Theme structure.  Everything lives in source.
In a the future / in a perfect world, Pattern Lab would be an external submodule that could completely live on its own.
