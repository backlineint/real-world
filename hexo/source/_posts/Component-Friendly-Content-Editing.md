## Section Outline

* So many options out there. We've found that a combination of tools provides the best experience.
* Nodes with Paragraph Fields with Panelizer and Panels IPE enabled.
* Content on the node functions as initial wizard.  Anything custom to that node, mostly using paragraph fields.
* Saving node brings to Panels IPE.  You see Node specific content, along with default blocks.
* Can re-arrange and add custom blocks.
* Fields and blocks are components using paragraphs.
* Paragraphs use UI Patterns to define and map components.

Notes:
* All plays nicely with panels IPE.

Dos:
* Keep things at the component level - field are paragraphs, not individual standalone fields.

Editing Challenges:
* Paragraphs on the node move as a single block even when containing mutliple paragraphs.
* Paragraphs on the node must be edited on the node edit form, not the IPE.
* Blocks (even with paragraphs) can be nicely edited using quickedit.
