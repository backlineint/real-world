We're still clearly in the early days here, and much of what we're doing could be more Drupal-y.  So where does the community see this headed in the future?  And what is in progress now?

* What's Missing:
    * Improvements to Drillability / Passing context to children.
    * A more visual representation of components.
    * More cohesive solution - way too many different tools.
    * A pattern library in Drupal?
* What is in progess:
    * Various approaches to inline templates.
    * UI patterns module continued development.
* What feels like the right solution:
    * A component aware version of Outside in and/or panels IPE.
    * Mapping Managed in the UI - UI Patterns Module approach feels close.
    * Should the pattern library live in Drupal or not?
