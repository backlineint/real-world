Section Outline:

* Smart Re-use
    * Extends, Embed, and Twig Blocks.
    * Style Modifiers
* Mapping just the data you need:
    * Twig Field Value - get partial data from render arrays.
        * Values
        * Properties
        * Fields on references entities
        * Caching related concerns.
    * Custom Twig Plugins
    * Preprocess functions
    * UI Patterns Module - manage mapping in UI.
* Debugging
* Handling Pattern Lab Only Things
    * Different markup / Filters
    * Internal Patterns
    * 
* Gulp tasks for different jobs - pattern lab work, vs Drupal, vs build only vs all.

Notes: 
* I went way overboard in mapping in Twig Templates - don't be like me.
* Maybe this needs to be broken out into different sections - streamlining the process / mapping just the date you need...
