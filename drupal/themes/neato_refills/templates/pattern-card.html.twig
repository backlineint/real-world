{#
Getting referenced entities with UI Patterns:
* The mapping approach below can work, but feels like it defeats the purpose a bit.
* As long as you don't need to split up the data, you could also make this work by using
  a display mode for the referenced entity and configuring a UI pattern for that.
* Future versions of UI Patterns will support sub-patterns which should make this
  a whole lot easier.
